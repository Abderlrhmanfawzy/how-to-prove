\section{Solution 5}
\subsection{Solution 5 (a)}
Let $a_1$ and $a_2$ be arbitrary element in $A$. Suppose $f(a_1) =
f(a_2)$. It follows that $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 - 1) = (a_2 + 1)(a_1 - 1)$.
Solving it, we get $a_1 = a_2$. Since $a_1$ and $a_2$ are arbitrary we
can conclude that $f$ is one to one.

Let $a_1$ be arbitrary element in $A$. Let $a_2 = a_1 + 1 / a_1 - 1$.
Then it follows that $f(a_2) = f(a_1)$. So, $\forall a_1 \in A \exists
a_2 \in A(f(a_2) = f(a_1))$.

\subsection{Solution 5 (b)}
$(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $(a_1, a_2) \in f \circ f$. Then it follows
$\exists a_3 \in A (a_1, a_2) \in f$ and $(a_3,a_2) \in f$. We know
that $f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{x - 1}$. So, $a_3 = \frac{a_1 + 1}{a_1 -
  1}$. Solving it, we get $a_1 = \frac{a_3 + 1}{a_1 - 1}$. Similarly
from $(a_3, a_2)$ we get, $a_2 = \frac{a_3 + 1}{a_1 - 1}$. So, $a_1 =
a_2$. Since $a_1 = a_2$, it follows that $(a_1, a_2) \in i_A$. So, $f
\circ f \subseteq i_A$.

$(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose $(a_1, a_2) \in i_A$. Then it follows that $a_1
= a_2$. Since $a_1 \in A$, it follows that $(a_1, \frac{a_1 + 1}{a_1 -
  1}) \in f$. Deducing, we get $(\frac{a_1 + 1}{a_1 - 1}, a_1) \in f$.
So, $(a_1, a_2) \in f \circ f$. Since $a_1$ and $a_2$ are arbitrary,
it follows that $i_A \subseteq f \circ f$.

\section{Solution 6}
\subsection{Solution 6 (a)}
$f(2) = \{y \in R \mid y^2 < 2\}$

\subsection{Solution 6 (b)}
\subsubsection{Proof for one-to-one}
Let $r_1, r_2$ be arbitrary element in $R$ such that $f(r_1) =
f(r_2)$. So, $\{y \in R \mid y^2 < r_1\} = \{y \in R \mid y^2 < r_2\}$
. Now those two sets can be equivalent only if $r_1 = r_2$
\subsubsection{Proof that it is not onto}
Suppose $a = \{1,2\}$. such that $f(r) = a$ for some $r$. It follows
that $\{y \in R \mid y^2 < r\} = \{1,2\}$. But for any $x \in R$,
$f(x) \neq \{1,2\}$.

\section{Solution 7}
\subsection{Solution 7(a)}
$\{1,2,3,4\}$

\subsection{Solution 7(b)}
\subsubsection{Proof that it is not one to one}
Suppose $b_1 = \{\{1,2\}, \{3,4\}\}$ and $b_2 = \{\{1,2,3\}, \{4\}\}$.
It follows that $f(b_1) = f(b_2)$. But $b_1 \neq b_2$. So, $f$ is not
one to one.

\subsubsection{Proof for onto}
Let $a$ be an arbitrary element in $A$. Suppose $b = \{\{a\}\}$. Then
$f(b) = \cup{b} = a$. Since $a$ was arbitrary, we can conclude that
$f$ is onto.

\section{Solution 8}
\subsection{Solution 8 (a)}
Suppose $g \circ f$ is onto. Then it follows that $\forall c \in C
\exists a \in A(g \circ f(a) = c)$. Let $c_1$ be arbitrary element in
$C$. From universal instantiation, it follows that $\exists a \in A(g
\circ f(a) = c_1)$. So there is $\exists a \in A$ such that $g \circ
f(a) = c_1$. Since $f$ is a function, let $f(a) = b$ for some $b \in
B$. Then it follows that $g(b) = c_1$.

\subsection{Solution 8 (b)}
Suppose $g \circ f$ is one to one. Let $a_1, a_2$ be arbitrary element
of $A$. Suppose $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$. We know that $g \circ f(a_1) = g
\circ f(a_2)$, So, $a_1 = a_2$. Since $a_1$ and $a_2$ are arbitrary,
we can conclude that $f$ is one-to-one.

\section{Solution 9}
\subsection{Solution 9 (a)}
Suppose $f$ is onto and $g$ is not one to one. Suppose $a_1, a_2$ be
some element in $A$. Let $f(a_1) = b_1$ and $f(a_2) = b_2$. We know
that $g$ is not one to one, so $g(b_1) = g(b_2) \land b_1 \neq b_2$.
From $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$, it follows that $g \circ f(a_1) = g \circ
f(a_2)$. Similarly we know that $b_1 \neq b_2$, so $a_1 \neq a_2$. So,
$\exists a_1 \in A \exists a_2 \in A(g \circ f(a_1) = g \circ f(a_2)
\land a_1 \neq a_2$. Hence $g \circ f$ is not one to one.

\subsection{Solution 9 (b)}
Suppose $f$ is not onto and $g$ is one to one. Since $f$ is not onto,
it follows that $\exists b \in B \forall a \in A(f(a) \neq b)$. Since
$g$ is one to one, it follows that $\neg b_1 \in B \exists b \in
B(f(b_1) = f(b) \land b_1 \neq b)$. Suppose $g(b) = c$. From $\exists
b \in B \forall a \in A((f(a) \neq b)$, it follows that $g \circ f(a)
\neq c$ and since $g$ one to one, $\neg b_2 \in B(g(b_2) = c \land b^2
\neq b)$. So, $g \circ f$ is not onto.

\section{Solution 10}
\subsection{Solution (a)}
Suppose $f$ is one to one. Let $c_1$ and $c_2$ be arbitrary element in
$C$. Since $c_1 \in C$ and $C \subseteq A$ it follows that $f(c_1)
\neq fc(c_2) \lor c_1 = c_2$. So, $f \mid C$ is one to one.

\subsection{Solution (b)}
Suppose $f \mid C$ is onto. Let $a$ be arbitrary element in $A$. Let
us consider the cases:
\\ Case 1. $a \in C$. We know that $f \mid C$ is onto. So, since $C
\subseteq A$, we can conclude that $f$ is onto.
\\ Case 2. $a \notin C$. Suppose $f(a) = b$ for some $b \in B$. We
already know that $f \mid C :: C -> B$ is onto. So, for some $a_1 \in
A$, $f \mid C (a_1) = b$. So, $\forall a \in A \exists b \in B(f(a) =
b)$.

\subsection{Solution (c)}
\subsubsection{Example for (a)}
\begin{align*}
  A = \{1,2\}
  B = \{3\} \\
  C = \{1\} \\
  f = \{(1,3), (2,3)\} \\
  f \mid C = \{(1,3)\} 
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Example for (b)}
\begin{align*}
  A = \{1,2\}
  B = \{3,4\} \\
  C = \{1\} \\
  f = \{(1,3), (2,4)\} \\
  f \mid C = \{(1,3)\} 
\end{align*}

\section{Solution 11}
\subsection{Solution (a)}
Suppose $A$ has more than one element. Let $a_1 \in A$ and $a_2 \in A$
such that $a_1 \neq a_2$. Since $f$ is a constant function $\exists b
\in B, f(a_1) = b$ and $f(a_2) = b$. So, $\exists a_1 \in A \exists
a_2 \in A(f(a_1) = f(a_2) \land a_1 \neq a_2)$. So, $f$ is not onto.

\subsection{Solution (b)}
Suppose $B$ has more than one element. Let $b_1 \in B$ and $b_2 \in B$
such that $b_1 \neq b_2$. Since $f$ is a constant either $f(a) = b_1$
or $f(a) = b_2$ where $a$ is an arbitrary number in $A$. Let us
consider the cases:
Case 1. $f(a) = b_2$. For $b_1 \in B$. $\forall a \in A(f(a) \neq
b_1)$. So, $f$ is not onto.
Case 2. $f(a) = b_1$. For $b_2 \in B$, $\forall a \in A(f(a) \neq
b_2)$. So, $f$ is not onto.

\section{Solution 12}
$(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $f \cup g$ is one to one. Let $c$ be an
arbitrary element in $Ran(f)$. Then $\exists a \in A$ such that $f(a)
= c$. We have to prove that $c \notin Ran(g)$. We know that $(a,c) \in
f \cup g$. Since $f \cup g$ is one to one, $\neg \exists a_1 \in A \cup B \exists
a \in A \cup B(f \cup g(a_1) = f \cup g(a) \land a_1 \neq a)$. We know
that $f$ already has $c$ in it's Range. So, $\neg \exists b \in B$,
such that $g(b) = c$. So, $c \notin Ran(R)$.

$(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose $Ran(f) \cap Ran(g) = \emptyset$. Let $x_1,
x_2$ be arbitrary element in $A \cup B$ such that $f \cup g(x_1) = f
\cup g(x_2)$. We know that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. So, let us
consider the cases:
Case 1. $x_1 \in A$ Then it follows that $f(x_1) = c$ for some $c \in
C$. So, $f \cup g(x_1) = c$. Also, $f \cup g(x_2) = c$. Now let us
consider the case for $x_2$. \\
$x_1 \in A$ Then it follows that $f(x_2) = c$. But we know that $f$ is
one to one. So this is only possible if $x_1 = x_2$. \\
$x_2 \in B$. Then it follows that $f \cup g(x_2) = c$. So, $(x_2, c)
\in g$. But we know that $Ran(f) \cap Ran(g) = \emptyset$. So this is
not possible. \\
Case 2. Same as case one.

\section{Solution 13}
Suppose $S$ is one to one. Let $a$ be an arbitrary element in $A$. \\
Existence proof. Since $S \circ R$ is a function, $\exists c \in C (S
\circ R(a) = c$. So, $\exists b \in B$ such that $(a,b) \in R$. \\
Uniqueness proof. Suppose $(a,b_1) \in R$ and $(a,b_2) \in R$. From $S
\circ R$, it follows that $(b_1, c_1) \in S$ and $(b_2, c_2) \in S$.
So, $(a,c_1) \in S \circ R$ and $(a,c_2) \in S \circ R$. Since $S
\circ R$ is a function, it follows that $c_1 = c_2$. So, $(b_1, c_1)
\in S$ and $(b_2, c_1) \in S$. But since $S$ is one to one this is not
possible. So, $b_1 = b_2$.

\section{Solution 14}
\subsection{Solution (a)}
Suppose $R$ is reflexive and $f$ is onto. Let $b$ be arbitrary element
in $B$. Since $f$ is onto, it follows that $\exists a \in A$ such that
$f(a) = b$. Now $a \in A$ and since $R$ is reflexive $(a,a) \in R$.
From the definition of $S$, it follows that $(b,b) \in S$. Since $b$
is arbitrary we can conclude that $S$ is reflexive.

\subsection{Solution (b)}
Suppose $R$ is transitive and $f$ is one to one. Let $b_1, b_2$ and
$b_3$ be arbitrary element in $B$ such that $(b_1, b_2) \in S$ and
$(b_2, b_3) \in S$. From $(b_1, b_2) \in S$ it follows that $(a_1,
a_2) \in R$ such that $f(a_1) = b_1$ and $f(a_2) = b_2$. Similarly,
$(a_3,a_4) \in R$ such that $f(a_3) = b_2$ and $f(a_4) = b_3$. But
$f(a_2) = b_2$ and $f(a_3) = b_2$ is not possible since $f$ is one to
one. So, $a_2 = a_3$. So from $(a_1, a_2) \in R$ and $(a_2, a_4) \in
R$ it follows that $(a_1, a_4) \in R$. From the definition of $S$, it
follows that $(b_1, b_3) \in S$. Since $b_1, b_2$ and $b_3$ are
arbitrary we can conclude that $S$ is transitive.

\section{Solution 15}
\subsection{Solution (a)}Let $X$ be an arbitrary element in $A/R$.
From $X \in A / R$, it follows that $\exists x \in A$ such that $x \in
X$. So, from the definition of $g$, $g(x) = X$. Since $X$ is
arbitrary, we can conclude that $g$ is onto.

\subsection{Solution (b)}
$(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $g$ is one to one. Let $a_1, a_2$ be arbitrary
element on $A$ such that $(a_1, a_2) \in R$. Since $R$ is reflexive it
follows that $(a_1, a_2) \in R$. From the definition of $g$, it
follows that $g(a_1) = [a_1]_R$. From $(a_1, a_2) \in R$, it follows
that $[a_1]_R = [a_2]_R$. So, $g(a_1) = [a_1]_R$ and $g(a_2) =
[a_1]_R$. But we know that $g$ is one to one, so $a_1 = a_2$. So,
$(a_1, a_2) \in i_A$. Since $a_1$ and $a_2$ are arbitrary element, $R
\subseteq i_A$. Let $a_1, a_2$ be arbitrary element on $i_A$ such that
$(a_1, a_2) \in i_A$. From the property of identity relation, it
follows that $a_1 = a_2$. Since $R$ is reflexive, it follows that
$(a_1, a_2) \in R$. So, $i_A \subseteq R$.

$(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose $R = i_A$. Let $(a_1, a_2)$ be arbitrary
element on $A$ such that $g(a_1) = g(a_2)$. From $g(a_1) = g(a_2)$, it
follows that $[a_1] = [a_2]$. So, $(a_1, a_2) \in R$. From $R = i_A$,
it follow that $a_1 = a_2$.

\section{Solution 16}
$(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $h$ is one to one. Let $x,y$ be arbitrary
element in $A$ such that $f(x) = f(y)$. We know that $\forall x \in
A(h([x]_R) = f(x))$. So from $f(x) = f(y)$, it follows that $[x]_R =
[y]_R$. So, $(x,y) \in R$.

$(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose $\forall x \in A \forall y \in A(f(x) = f(y)
\implies xRy)$. Let $X_1, X_2$ be arbitrary element in $A/R$ such that
$h(X_1) = h(X_2)$. From $X_1 \in A/R$, it follows that $\exists a_1
\in A$ such that $a_1 \in X_1$. From $h([x]_R) = f(x)$, it follows
that $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$. From our initial assumption, we can conclude
that $a_1Ra_2$. So, $[a_1]_R = [a_2]_R$. So, $X_1 = X_2$. Since $X_1$
and $X_2$ are arbitrary, we can conclude that $h$ is one to one.

\section{Solution 17}
\subsection{Solution (a)}
Suppose $f$ is onto and $g:B \to C, h:B \to C \text{ dvand } g \circ f
= h \circ f$.
$(\Rightarrow)$ Let $b,c$ be arbitrary element in $B$ and $C$
respectively such that $(b,c) \in G$. Since $f$ is onto, $\exists a
\in A$ such that $f(a) = b$. From $g \circ f = h \circ f$, it follows
that $g(b) = h(b)$. From $(b,c) \in g$, it follows that $h(b) = c$.
So, $(b,c) \in h$. Since $b$ and $c$ are arbitrary we can conclude
that $g \subseteq h$.

\subsection{Solution (b)}
Let $b$ be arbitrary element in $B$. Suppose $C = \{c_1, c_2\}, g = B
\times \{c_1\}$ and $h=[B \setminus \{b\} \times \{c_1\} \cup
\{(b,c_2)\}]$. Then $g \neq h$. So by assumption $g \circ f \neq h
\circ f$. So, $g \circ f(a) = h \circ f(a)$ for $\exists a \in A$. By
the way $g$ and $h$ are defined, the only way they are not equal is
when $a=b$. So, $f(a) = b$. Since $b$ is arbitrary, $f$ is onto.
