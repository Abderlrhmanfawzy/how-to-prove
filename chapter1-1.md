Deductive Reasoning and Logical connectives
---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------

Exercise 1
-----------

1. Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:

(a) We’ll have either a reading assignment or homework problems, but we
won’t have both homework problems and a test.

(b) You won’t go skiing, or you will and there won’t be any snow.

(c) √7 ≤ 2.

(a)

P = We'll have reading assignment.

Q = We'll have homework problems.

T = We'll have test.

(P ∨ Q) ∧ ¬(Q ∧ T)

(b)

P = You go skiing

Q = There will be snow

¬P ∨ (P ∧ ¬Q)

(c)

√7 ≤ 2 (The question is not equal to.)

P = √7 < 2

Q = √7 = 2

¬(P ∨ Q)

Exercise 2
-----------

2. Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:
(a) Either John and Bill are both telling the truth, or neither of them is.
(b) I’ll have either fish or chicken, but I won’t have both fish and mashed
potatoes.
(c) 3 is a common divisor of 6, 9, and 15.

(a)

J = John is telling the truth
B = Bill is telling the truth

(J ∧ B) ∨ (¬J ∧ ¬B)

(b)

F = I'll have fish.
C = I'll have chicken
P = I'll have mashed potatoes

(F ∨ C) ^ ¬(F ∧ P)

(c)

X = 3 is a common divisor of 6
Y = 3 is a common divisor of 9
Z = 3 is a common divisor of 15

X ∧ Y ∧ Z

Exercise 3
-----------

Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:
(a) Alice and Bob are not both in the room.
(b) Alice and Bob are both not in the room.
(c) Either Alice or Bob is not in the room.
(d) Neither Alice nor Bob is in the room.

A = Alice is in the room.
B = Bob is in the room.

(a)

A ∧ B = Alice and Bob are both in the room

¬(A ∧ B)

(b)

(¬A ∧ ¬B)

(c)

¬A ∨ ¬B

(d)

(¬A ∧ ¬B)

Exercise 4
----------

Ofcourse these two doesn't make sense:

(b) ¬(P, Q, ∧R).
(d) (P ∧ Q)(P ∨ R).
