Exercise 1
-----------

1. Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:
(a) We’ll have either a reading assignment or homework problems, but we
won’t have both homework problems and a test.
(b) You won’t go skiing, or you will and there won’t be any snow.
(c) √7 ≤ 2.

(a)

P = We'll have reading assignment.
Q = We'll have homework problems.
T = We'll have test.

(P ∨ Q) ∧ ¬(Q ∧ T)

(b)

P = You go skiing
Q = There will be snow

¬P ∨ (P ∧ ¬Q)

(c)

√7 ≤ 2

P = √7 < 2
Q = √7 = 2

¬(P ∨ Q)
