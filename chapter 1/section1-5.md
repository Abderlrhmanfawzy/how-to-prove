The Conditional and Biconditional Connectives
-----------------------------------------------

* Implication has a truth part and causality part.
* Leave the causation part to the philosophers and just in mathematics
  we will just focus on the truth part.
* Whenever we have genuine implication (with causality), the truth
  behaviour of the conditional is the correct one.
* When we do have a genuine implication, the definition of the
  conditional will agree with the way implication behaves. And when we
  don't have genuine implication, the conditional will still be defined.
