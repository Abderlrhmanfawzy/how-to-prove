\section{Problem 1}

$R = \{(a,bad), (a,cab), (b,bad), (b,bed), (b,cab), (c,cab), (d,bad),
(d, bed), (e,bed), (e,bed)\}$

\section{Problem 2}

$A = \{cat, dog, bird, rat\}$
$R = \{(x,y) \in A \times A \mid there is at least one letter that
occurs in both of the words x and y\}$

$R = \{(cat, cat), (cat, rat), (dog, dog), (dog, birds), (bird, dog),
(bird, bird), (bird, rat), (rat, cat), (rat, bird), (rat, rat)\}$

\begin{itemize}
\item Reflexive
\item Symmetric
\item Not transitive: there is an edge from bird to rat and rat to
  cat. But there is no edge from bird to cat.
