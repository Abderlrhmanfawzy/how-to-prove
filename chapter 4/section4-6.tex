\section{Problem 1}

\begin{align*}
  \{\{1\},\{2\},\{3\}\}
  \{\{1,2\},\{3\}\}
  \{\{1,3\},\{2\}\}
  \{\{2,3\},\{1\}\}
  \{\{1,2,3\}\}
\end{align*}

\section{Problem 2}

Identity relation and $A \times A$

\section{Problem 3}

\subsection{Solution (a)}
$R = \{(x,y) \in W \times W \mid \text{the words x and y start with the same
letter} \}$

\begin{itemize}
\item Reflexive: Let $x$ be an arbitrary element in $W$. Then $(x,x)
  \in R$ since both start from the same letter as they are same.
\item Symmetric: Let $x,y$ be an arbitrary element in $W$ such that
  $xRy$. Now we know that $x$ and $y$ start with the same. So, $yRx$.
\item Transitive: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be arbitrary element in $W$ such

  that $xRy$ and $yRz$. Both $x$ and $y$ start with the same letter.
  Similarly, $y$ and $z$ start with the same letter. So, $xRz$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution (b)}
Counterexample for transitive:
\begin{align*}
  ("hello","hask") \in S, ("hask", "kitten") \in S \\
  ("hello", kitten) \notin S
\end{align*}

\subsection{Solution (c)}
$T = \{(x,y) \in W \times W \mid \text{the words x and y have the same
  number of letters}\}$

\begin{itemize}
\item Reflexive: Let $x$ be an arbitrary element in $W$. It follows
  that $xTx$ since it has the same number of letters.
\item Symmetric: Let $x$ and $y$ be arbitrary element in $W$ such that
  $xTy$. Now from $xTy$, we get to know that $x$ and $y$ have the same
  number of letters. So, $yTx$.
\item Transitive: Let $x,y$ and $z$ be arbitrary element in $T$ such
  that $xTy$ and $yTz$. Now we know $x$ and $y$ have same number of
  letters. Similarly from $yTz$, we know that $y$ and $z$ have the
  same number of letters. So, $x$ and $z$ has the same number of
  letters. So, $xRz$.
\end{itemize}
