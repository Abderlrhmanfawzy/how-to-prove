\section{Problem 1}
\subsection{Solution (a)}

Reflexive closure of $R = \{(b,b), (c,c), (a,a), (a,b), (b,c),
(c,b)\}$ \\
Symmetric closure of $R = (a,a), (a,b), (b,a), (b,c), (c,b)$ \\
Transitive closure of $R = (a,a), (a,b), (a,c), (a,b), (b,c), (c,b),
(b,b)$

\subsection{Solution (b)}

Reflexive closure of $R = \{(x,y \in R \times R \mid x < y \lor x =
y)\}$ \\
$= \{(x,y) \in R \times R \mid x \leq y\}$ \\ \\
Symmetric closure of $R = \{(x,y) \in R \times R \mid x < y \lor y <
x\}$ \\ \\
Transitive closure of $R = R$

\subsection{Solution (c)}

Reflexive and symmetric closure of $D_r = D_r$
Transitive closure of $D_r = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$

\section{Problem 3}
\subsection{Solution (a)}

Suppose $R$ is asymmetric. Let $x$ and $y$ be an arbitrary element in
$A$ such that $xRy$ and $yRx$. Since $R$ is asymmetric, from $xRy$ it
follows that $(y,x) \notin R$. But this contradicts with out
assumption that $yRx$. So, it is vacuously true.

\subsection{Solution (b)}
Suppose $R$ is a strict partial order on $A$. Let $x$ and $y$ be
arbitrary element in $A$ such that $(x,y) \in R$. Let us try to prove
by contradiction. Suppose $(y,x) \in R$. Then from transitive property
of $R$ it follows that $(x,x) \in R$. But this contradicts the fact
that $R$ is irreflexive. So $(y,x) \notin R$.

\section{Problem 4}
\subsection{Solution (a)}
Suppose $R$ is a strict partial order on $A$. Let $S$ be the reflexive
closure on $R$. That means $S = R \cup i_A$.
\subsubsection{Proof of reflexive}
By the definition of reflexive closure, $S$ is reflexive.

\subsubsection{Proof of transitive}
Let $x,y$ and $z$ be arbitrary elements in $A$ such that $(x,y) \in S$
and $(y,z) \in S$. We have to prove that $(x,z) \in S$. Now we know
that $S = R \cup i_A$. Let us consider the cases separately:
Case 1. $(x,y) \in R$ Now this itself has two sub cases within it.
\begin{itemize}
\item $y,z \in R$ We know that $R$ is transitive, so $x,z \in R$.
  So $(x,z) \in R \cup i_A$.
\item $y,z \in i_A$ From the property of identity set it follows that
  $y = z$. Substituting it in $(x,y) \in R$, we get $(x,z) \in R$. So
  $(x,z) \in R \cup i_A$.
\end{itemize}
Case 2. $(x,y) \in i_A$ From the property of identity set it follows
that $x = y$. Substituting that in $(y,z) \in S$ gives $(x,z) \in S$.

\subsubsection{Proof of Anti-symmetric}
Let $x$ and $y$ be arbitrary elements in $A$ such that $(x,y) \in S$
and $(y,x) \in S$. We have to prove that $x = y$. Now we know
that $S = R \cup i_A$. Let us consider the cases separately:
Case 1. $(x,y) \in R$ Now this itself has two sub cases within it.
\begin{itemize}
\item $y,x in R$. Since $R$ is transitive, it follows that $(x,x) \in
  R$. But we know that $R$ is irreflexive, so this contradicts the
  fact that $(x,x) \notin R$. So $(y,x) \notin R$.
\item $y,x \in i_A$ From the property of identity set it follows that
  $y = x$. 
\end{itemize}
Case 2. $(x,y) \in i_A$. From the property of identity set, it follows
that $x = y$

\subsection{Solution (b)}
Suppose $R$ is total strict order. Let $x$ and $y$ be arbitrary
elements in $A$. We have to prove that $xSy \lor ySx$. We know that R
satisfies trichotomy, so $xRy \lor yRx \lor x = y$. Let us consider
the cases separately:
\begin{itemize}
\item Case 1. $xRy$ Since $S = R \cup i_A$, it follows that $(x,y) \in
  S$. So $xSy \lor ySx$.
\item Case 2. $yRx$ Similar to the case 1 proof.
\item Case 3. $x = y$ So, $(x,y) \in i_A$. It follows that $(x,y) \in
  R \cup i_A$. So $xSy \lor ySx$.
\end{itemize}
